## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Laravel Project Setup with MySQL (Instead of SQLite)
### This documentation outlines the steps required to set up a Laravel project to run with MySQL on a local development environment (XAMPP + Laravel 12.x).

## üîß Prerequisites
PHP 8.4.x
Composer
Laravel (v12.x)
MySQL (via XAMPP)
VS Code / Terminal

## üß± 1. Install Laravel Project (if not already)
laravel new MissionGermany
cd MissionGermany

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Update Database Configuration
Open the .env file and update the database section:
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=missiongermany_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
## ‚úÖ You replaced the SQLite configuration with MySQL.

## üóÇÔ∏è 3. Create MySQL Database
Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin and create a new database:
Database name: missiongermany_db

## ‚úÖ This matches the value you set in .env.

## üßπ 4. Clear Config and Cache
Run the following commands to clear previous SQLite config:
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear

## üß™ 5. Test Database Connection & Run Migrations
php artisan migrate
If successful, it means MySQL is connected correctly, and your database is ready.

## üöÄ 6. Run the Laravel Development Server
php artisan serve
Visit your project in the browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000

## üîç 7. Check Laravel Version (Optional)
You can check which version of Laravel you are using with:
php artisan --version
Or check composer.json under "laravel/framework".

## üìÇ Summary of Changes Made
File Modified	Change Summary
.env	Changed DB_CONNECTION to mysql and set DB name, user, and password
MySQL (phpMyAdmin)	Created new DB: missiongermany_db
Terminal Commands	Cleared config/cache, ran migrations
